Q:
In the file hw1.s,  write ARM assembly code to find the maximum amount of
money that can be earned. The inputs to your code will be the base address of a .word array
(register r0) containing the non-negative integer stock price for each day, and the number of days
n (register r1), a non-negative integer. By the time your code is finished, the answer (i.e., the
maximum amount you can earn, a non-negative integer) must be computed in register r0.
